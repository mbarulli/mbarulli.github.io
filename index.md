# About me

## Earlier ...
After getting my degree in computer science from the University of Bologna (Italy), in 1995 I started my career as a researcher in parallel computing and numerical analysis, first at my alma mater and then at Loughbourough University (UK).  
In 1996 I left the academia to become the first employee of the Italian branch of MCI Worldcom in Milan. It was great to be part of the telco boom of the late '90s, from a few people in a small office to a huge data center with hundreds of colleagues.

### Founder at [eXtrapola](https://www.extrapola.com)
In 1998 I co-founded eXtrapola, an online media monitoring service provider. I’ve been the CEO of eXtrapola for 7 years leading its growth, designing products, raising money, selecting and hiring people, building the engineering team, …

### Founder at [Clipperz.is](https://clipperz.is)
Web applications are extremely convenient and effective, but this is not a good reason to give up privacy, security and ultimately freedom. Unfortunately, often there are no alternatives, but trust SaaS providers and hope they act properly.  
In 2005, based on this realization I co-founded Clipperz along with my friend [Giulio Cesare Solaroli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gcsolaroli/). We envisioned a new architecture for web apps, designed to give people complete and exclusive ownership of their data.  
We decided to test this approach, based on client-side cryptograhy, on a very sensitive problem: managing and storing passwords. Therefore Clipperz became the first online password manager, the first web application that knows nothing about its users and their data.

### Ebooks and digital publishing
Starting in 2008, I got interested in ebooks and digital publishing. I gained a good understanding of the sector, co-organized the first Italian barcamp and this landed me a job as CFO and strategist at Simplicissimus Book Farm, now [StreetLib](https://www.streetlib.com/), a company founded by [Antonio Tombolini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniotombolini/), a serial entrepreneur that sees further than anybody else I’ve ever met.  
StreetLib provides a wide range of solutions for the digital publishing ecosystem: from selfpublishing to print-on-demand. StreetLib is a digital gateway to the international book market that connects authors, publishers, distributors, and retailers on a global scale.

### Urban cycling
I’m a convinced urban cyclist. In 2009 along with Antonio Tombolini, I started Ciclourbano.it a website that promotes cycling with a special focus on cargobikes and family bikes. I would love one day to turn this passion into a real business.


**What I can do for you**  
During these years I learned to drive the conceptual development and implementation of projects from idea to release. Web apps, data security and privacy, Bitcoin, digital publishing, cryptography, cycling, television, … are some of the markets I’ve a decent experience of. I’m also quite good at writing business plans, raising money from investors, hiring smart people, selecting the right business tools, intermediating engineers and sales people, … I also like to evangelize about things I believe in.
