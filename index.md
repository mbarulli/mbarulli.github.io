# About me


I love to design and build products that do solve real problems, tools that could make life easier and more just for people.

## Founder at [Bernstein.io](https://www.bernstein.io)
Blockchain, intellectual property, privacy and security
I’m the co-founder of Bernstein, a web application that provides blockchain based solutions for securing and managing intellectual property assets.

Along with Giulio Cesare Solaroli, I envisioned a new kind of web apps built upon a strong Javascript cryptographic engine. Apps that look and behave like regular web apps, but designed to not reveal user data to the server. We dubbed them “zero-knowledge web apps”, other prefer to use the term “host-proof web apps”.

We decided to test this approach on a very sensitive problem: managing and storing passwords! And we built an online password manager that proves you can build a web application that knows nothing about its users and their data: Clipperz.

## Earlier ...
After my graduation in computer science at University of Bologna (Italy), I started in 1995 as a researcher in parallel computing and numerical analysis, first at my alma mater and then at Loughbourough University (UK). In 1996 I became the first employees of the Italian branch of MCI Worldcom in Milan. It was great to be part of the startup process: from just the country manager and myself to more than 200 people, from a small apartment to brand new offices and a huge data center.

In 1998 I co-founded [eXtrapola](https://www.extrapola.com), an online media monitoring service provider. I’ve been the CEO of eXtrapola for 7 years leading its growth, designing products, raising money, selecting and hiring people, building the engineering team, …


## Founder at [Clipperz.is](https://clipperz.is)
Clipperz was born out of the idea that people should have complete and exclusive ownership of their data. Web applications are extremely convenient and effective, but this is not a good reason to give up privacy, security and ultimately freedom. Unfortunately today you have no choice, but trust web application providers and hope they act properly.


## Ebooks and digital publishing
Starting in 2008 I got interested in ebooks and digital publishing. I gained a good understanding of the sector, organized the first Italian barcamp and this landed me a job at Simplicissimus Book Farm that provides both a distribution platform for ebooks and a self-publishing service.
Simplicissimus was founded by Antonio Tombolini, a proven entrepreneur that see further than anybody else I’ve ever met.

## Urban cycling
I’m a convinced urban cyclist. In 2009 along with Antonio Tombolini, I started Ciclourbano.it a website that promotes cycling with a special focus on cargobikes and family bikes. I would love one day to turn it into a real business.


What I can do for you
During these years I learned to drive the conceptual development and implementation of projects from idea to release. Web apps, data security and privacy, Bitcoin, digital publishing, cryptography, cycling, television, … are some of the markets I’ve a decent experience of. I’m also quite good at writing business plans, raising money from investors, hiring smart people, selecting the right business tools, intermediating engineers and sales people, … I also like to evangelize about things I believe in.
